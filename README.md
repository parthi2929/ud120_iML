These are my total work artifacts for Udacity's "Intro to Machine Learning" _(Jun 2018)_

https://eu.udacity.com/course/intro-to-machine-learning--ud120

maildir (enraon mail dataset) is not included (currently empty) due to its huge size. Please ensure including it when you run programs referencing it (mostly not needed except pre processing from raw data)

**Note:**  
If you use wp_tools script (convert ipynb to html with attachments embedded as base64) be aware of below issues
1. Double quote with 0x9d is not recognized. [Issue link](https://github.com/ipython/ipython/issues/11222)
2. output_scroll is missed, so long outputs are not given scroll in html output. [Issue link](https://github.com/jupyter/help/issues/391)
